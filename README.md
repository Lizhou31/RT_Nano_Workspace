# RT_Nano_Workspace
## Description
This workspace is dedicated to the RT-Thread nano kernel, tailored for use with the STM32 series. Its primary objective are to test the kernel's features, build custom components, and develop applications that align with my goals. The following are the features I intend to develpe or test:  
- [X] Finsh
- [ ] OpenAMP
- [ ] OTA
- [ ] Device framework
- [ ] Use CMake
- [ ] Unit test framework
- [ ] Online simulation
- [ ] POSIX
- [ ] Another useful library
